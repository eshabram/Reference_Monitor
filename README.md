### Run The Reference Monitor:
To run the reference monitor, place this script anywhere you please and type this into the commmand prompt:
```
python3 acm.py
```
You will be prompted with several options, most of which will ask for a relative filepath. Enter the desired
filepath. 

NOTE: There is a hidden option to print out the linked list version, which is how it is actually stored, but 
can be hard to read. Use option '6' for this print.
